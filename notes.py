# Math operators, there are 6
# +, -, *, /, ** (exponents), % (modulo division)
print(4 + 8) # 12
print(8 - 2) # 6
print(-3 * -2) # 6
print(6 / 4) # 1.5
print(2 ** 4) # 16
print(12 % 5) #2
print(6 % 3) # 0
print(16 % 9) # 7

# +, and * are overloaded that means they do different things based on 
# inputs

print("Hello" + " There") # this is called concatenation
print("4" + "8")
print("4" + str(8)) # casting
# example of a prompt
name = input("What is your name?: ")
print("Hello " + name)
age = input("How old are you? ")
age = int(age) + 10 # casting
